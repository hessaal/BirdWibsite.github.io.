<h1>Birds of conservation concern in Ireland</h1>

<p>There are a number of birds in Ireland whose numbers are in decline. Some of those with a high priority for conservation are:</p>
<hr>
<h3>Barn Owl</h3>

<p>The barn owl is the most common owl and is found in most parts of the world. It has seen a huge decline in Ireland and Europe in recent years.</p>
